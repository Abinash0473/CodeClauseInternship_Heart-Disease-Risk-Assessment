Project Overview
Aim
The aim of this project is to build a user-friendly interface that allows users to input health metrics and develop a machine learning model to predict the risk of heart disease based on these inputs. This tool can serve as a preliminary risk assessment for individuals concerned about their cardiovascular health.

Description
Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection and assessment of heart disease risk are crucial for preventive healthcare. In this project, you will develop a web-based application where users can input their health data, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc. The application will utilize a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict the likelihood of heart disease and provide feedback to the user.

Technologies
Python: The primary programming language for model development and integration.
Flask or Streamlit: Used for creating the web-based user interface (UI). Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework, while Streamlit is a faster option for building data science applications.
Scikit-Learn: Employed for building and evaluating the machine learning model.
Additional Technologies: You are encouraged to integrate other technologies or libraries as needed, such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization, and advanced machine learning libraries like XGBoost.
